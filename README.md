**Code Explaination:**

The ApparelStore class is declared, which serves as the main class for the program.
The main method is defined, which is the entry point of the program. Inside this method, an example usage of the calculateTotalPrice method is demonstrated.
The calculateTotalPrice method is defined, which takes in several parameters: clientType, gender, category, brand, purchaseAmount, and isNewUser. It calculates and returns the total price based on the provided inputs.
Inside the method, two variables are declared: totalPrice to store the initial purchase amount and discount to keep track of the discount amount.
The code checks if the clientType is "online" or "instore" to determine the purchase channel.
If the clientType is "online", the code further checks the category of the apparel.
If the category is "accessories", the code checks the brand to determine if it matches "Chanel", "Louis Vuitton", or "Ck". If there's a match, a discount of 10% of the purchaseAmount is applied by multiplying it with 0.1.
Additionally, if the isNewUser flag is set to true, the code checks if the user's registration date is within the last 30 days. If the registration date is recent, an extra discount of 10% is added to the discount variable.
If the category is "clothes" and the purchaseAmount is greater than 150.0, a 10% discount is applied. However, if the brand is "Armani" or "Balenciaga", the discount is set to 0.0, indicating that there's no discount for these brands.
If the clientType is "online" and the customer is not a new user, an additional discount of $10 is added to the discount variable for purchases above $150. This discount is not dependent on the category or brand.
If the clientType is "instore" and the purchaseAmount is greater than or equal to 100.0, additional discounts and gift cards are applied based on the category and purchaseAmount.
If the category is "women" or "kids" and the purchaseAmount is greater than 250.0, a 10% discount is applied to the discount variable.
If the purchaseAmount is greater than 150.0, a $25 gift card is added to the discount variable.
After calculating the discounts, a cashback of 10% of the totalPrice is calculated and stored in the cashback variable.
The totalPrice is then reduced by subtracting the discount and cashback amounts.
Finally, the totalPrice is returned as the result of the calculateTotalPrice method.

In the example usage in the main method, the calculateTotalPrice method is called with "online" as the clientType, "women" as the gender, "accessories" as the category, "Chanel" as the brand, a purchaseAmount of 200.0, and isNewUser set to false. The calculated total price is then printed as output.
